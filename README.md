# MathDoku
MathDoku (also known as KenKen, KenDoku or Calcudoku) is a logic puzzle game.
<p>The rules of the game are:</p>

1. Digits may appear only once in each row and column
Similar to Sudoku, digits may only appear once in each row and column. In the 4 by 4 puzzle, these are the digits 1 to 4, in the 6 by 6 MathDoku the digits 1 to 6 and in the 9 by 9 the digits up to 9.

2. The grids are divided in cages with target numbers and operators
The grids are divided in clearly marked cages. Each cage has its target number and an operator (addition, subtraction, multiply or division sign).

3. Find a mathematical solution using the operator and target.
Find a mathematical solution to create the target number given the cage's operator. The target can be the sum, difference, product or quotient.

4. Know the number combinations
If a 3 cell cage has a '6' as target number and a + as operator, you need to fill in the numbers 1, 2 and 3. other combinations are not possible. It is important to recognize the possible number combinations that can occur in combination with the operator. The more operator combinations you know, the faster you will solve these math puzzles.

5. Each puzzle has only 1 solution
Just like Sudoku, Hidato and Numbrix, the MathDokus can have only 1 possible solution.
