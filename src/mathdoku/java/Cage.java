/**
 * MathDoku Cells are grouped in Cages (which can be of any size ranging from 1 to NxN,
 * where N is a number of Cells in one row/column).
 * <p>
 * Cages are highlighted on the board by thicker boundaries.
 * Each Cage has a label showing a target number followed by an arithmetic operator (+, -, x, รท).
 * It must be possible to obtain the target by applying the arithmetic operator to the numbers in that cage.
 * For - and รท, this can be done in any order.
 * <p>
 * Note: If a cage consists of a single cell, then no arithmetic operator is shown.
 * The label simply shows the number that must be in that cell.
